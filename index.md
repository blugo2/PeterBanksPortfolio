## Peter Banks 

Iâ€™m a junior at George Mason University (GMU) studying Economics and Math. I am planning to pursue a Ph.D. in Economics and a career in the public sector or acedamia.

I have demonstrated both an aptitude for academic rigor and initiative outside of the classroom. My course work includes multiple semesters in high level math, statistics, and economics. As noted on my attached resume, I also participated in a Summer 2018 internship at the GMU Center for the Study of Neuroeconomics that included award-winning student research and involved programing economic computer models in Python. I continued my work with the GMU Center for the Study of Neuroeconomics in the spring semester of 2019.
